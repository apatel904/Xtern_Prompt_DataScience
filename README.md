  I performed analysis on the given data for our VeloCityX app. The data itself was pretty easy to analyze and was clean enough. I dropped some of the duplicate values and any null values that were present in order to clean the file up. After that, I did some visualization to get an idea of our users and their involvement in our product. I realized that 20% of our users weren't making any purchases through our virtual merchandising system and we were missing out on possible profits from them. In order to present a solution for this, it was important for me to find out the reason why these 20% weren't buying anything from us. <br /> <br />
  I performed some analysis to find trends and patterns in our data. One particular trend caught my eye and that was the relationship between challenges participated by the user and the amount of sales made to that person. There was a positive correlation between the two columns. As the number of challenges participated by our user went up, the more likely they were to buy more items from us. The lower the number of challenges participated in, the lower the number of sales made. This meant that we needed a way to increase consumer interaction and participation in our app in order to increase our monetization. <br /> <br />
  Based on the data analysis and visualization, we need to make new challenges the users may be interested in participating. More participation is a higher chance of them buying some merchandise. A potential new fan challenge could be the **Engagement Challenge: Race Day Showdown** <br /> <br />
